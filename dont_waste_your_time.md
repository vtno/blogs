#I Wasted My Time, You Shouldn’t.
######Really, don’t waste it.

I have been managing my time seriously since my senior year at college. It was one of my best decision in my life.
For the most part of my teenager years, I let life events set my agenda. As if I were floating in the middle of the storm, I was taken by waves to places I do not wish to go.If I’m lucky I’ll like the place, but  seriously 90% of those places are simply a waste of time. I had little-to-no control over my own life. 

Keeping my grade up and studying to get into a good college are already hard enough. I also need to spend time hanging out with my friends and family. I need to practice my guitar, I need to have a social life. All those years I was just “reacting” with things coming into my life. I don’t have spare time to spend with myself. I finished only a few books during my entire high school years. The only real achievement I got was getting to a good college and that is it.

>"I wasted a lot of time on things that I don’t want to do. That is one of the main reasons I have accomplished so little." 

After a lot of trials and errors, reading lots of productivity books, I have summarised and adapt them into my own set of advices that I think they are pretty helpful.

#You got the right to say “No”
######It’s not that people will hate you.
It is really hard for me to say no someone asking for help. I used to accept every request from friends. Whether it’s their studying, projects or just things they said they need my help. All of my effort and time is spend for other people and it is not a bad thing right?

Wrong, it is a bad thing to say yes to everything coming your way. Like it or not, you will waste your time on other people tasks. You will have to use the time to spend with yourself on others and that is not good in the long run.

You have all the right to say no if you’re not comfortable with their request. Being kind is great, the world need more kindness but if it starts to become your burden just stop taking responsibility of other people and leave some room for yourself. You will have a lot more time, trust me.

#Aim high but one step at a time
######Go for big goal but plan every step along the way.
Do not be afraid of setting high goals. One of the reason why people achieve so little is that they set a safe, small, easy goals. What will you got from those kind of goals? My reason for setting high goals is even if you fail, you still get significant result out of your progress. You put more effort into it because you know it is big. You have more chance of achieving results. 

>Aim for the sky because if you missed, you will still be among the stars.

I have been learning Ruby on Rails framework for almost half a year by setting high goals. I had zero knowledge and now I’m a Rails developer for a great software house company. Instead of just setting my goal to learn Rails, I set my goals as getting a high-paid job as Rails developer. I thought I would learn Rails much faster, more efficient and also get paid while doing it. After my goal has been realised, I start break it down into smaller milestones I need to pass in order achieve it.

Because of that mindset I’m not only able to learn the framework, I also get into my current job. I didn’t just try to learn Rails. Instead, I tried to be a developer and what developer does is creating a product for his customer. So I start by finding a chance to build an actual product. 

Luckily, the startup company I applied for ask me to build a web application with Rails. I used my prior experience with other framework to literally hack my way through my first Rails app. I did everthing I could copying other people’s code. Find a specific tutorial for some of the functionalities. I even use logic from other language that there is a much better way to do it with Ruby. 

It was crappy but it worked. I’ve built my first product.

######Consequences
Because of that first product I built, I got to work part-time with my senior who is working on a Rails project for government sector at his company. It is a pretty big project that I actually learn the best practices of how to create a “good” Rails app. After this project, I apply at one of the coolest tech company in town and they hired me.

If my goal was just to learn Rails, I would still be reading some tutorial off of the internet and be nowhere near I am today. It would take a lot more time and I could miss my chance of applying at my desired company.

#Don’t plan too much
######You’ll just end up doing nothing
Planning is an essential part in making a great decision and achieve more result in less time. However, every great result is not going to be achieve if you don’t execute. Having a master plan that wil pave the way for your future means nothing if you don't start executing it. Have you ever talked to someone who always going through their plans...
